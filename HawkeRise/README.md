## About The Project

The objective of this project is to keep the hawker culture in Singapore alive.

HawkeRise aims to help digitally disadvantaged hawkers gain online exposure and at the same time, provide the public with an easy way to navigate themselves to these hawkers, thereby providing the much needed support to them.

This project was developed using Java, Python, Google Cloud SQL, SpringBoot and Android Studio.
